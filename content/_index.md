I am currently an assistant professor at Nara Institute of Science and
Technology (NAIST).
I received my Ph.D. in Information Science in 2019 at Osaka University, where
I worked under the supervision of [Prof. Shinji
Shimojo](https://sites.google.com/site/sshimojo/) and [Assoc. Prof. Susumu
Date](http://ds-server.ais.cmc.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/). Before starting my Ph.D.
program, I received my M.Sc. in Information Science and B.Eng. in Electronic
and Information Engineering at Osaka University.

My current research interests include Message Passing Interface (MPI) and
interconnection networks of high-performance computing systems. Specifically,
I have been working on how to dynamically reconfigure interconnects based
on the communication pattern of MPI applications. I am also interested in
other fields of parallel and distributed computing as well.

I worked as a part-time programmer for more than 7 years. During my carrier, I
designed and developed a wide variety of software including image analysis,
signal processing, factory automation, desktop and web applications.
