I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at [Nara Institute of Science
and Technology (NAIST)](http://www.naist.jp/en/), where I am a member of the
[Software Design and Analysis Laboratory](https://sdlab.naist.jp/).
I also serve as a guest faculty at [Cybermedia
Center](https://www.cmc.osaka-u.ac.jp/?lang=en), Osaka University.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2019 at Osaka University, where
I worked under the supervision of Prof. Shinji Shimojo and Prof. Susumu
Date. Before starting my Ph.D. program, I received my Master’s degree in
Computer Science and Bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Computer
Engineering at Osaka University.

My research mainly focuses on middleware for high-performance computing. In
particular, I study how to create software for efficiently moving data inside
a compute node, between compute nodes and from/to persistent storage on a
large-scale high-performance computing system.
