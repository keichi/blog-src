I am an assistant professor at [Nara Institute of Science and
Technology (NAIST)](http://www.naist.jp/en/), where I am a member of the
[Software Design and Analysis Laboratory](https://sdlab-web.naist.jp/english).
I also serve a guest faculty at [Cybermedia
Center](https://www.cmc.osaka-u.ac.jp/?lang=en), Osaka University.

I received my Ph.D. in Information Science in 2019 at Osaka University, where
I worked under the supervision of Prof. Shinji Shimojo and Assoc. Prof. Susumu
Date. Before starting my Ph.D. program, I received my Master’s degree in
Information Science and Bachelor’s degree in Electronic and Information
Engineering at Osaka University.

My research mainly focuses on middleware for high-performance computing. In
particular, I study how to create software for efficiently moving data inside
a compute node, between compute nodes and from/to persistent storage on a
large-scale high-performance computing system.

In addition to my academic work, I have been working as a professional
software engineer. I have designed and developed a wide variety of software,
including image analysis, signal processing, factory automation, desktop, and
web applications. Open-source projects are listed [here](/projects).
