I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Cybermedia
Center](http://www.cmc.osaka-u.ac.jp/?lang=en), Osaka University, Japan. I
work under the supervision of [Prof. Shinji
Shimojo](https://sites.google.com/site/sshimojo/) and [Assoc. Prof. Susumu
Date](http://ds-server.ais.cmc.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/). Before starting my Ph.D.
program, I received my M.Sc. in Information Science and B.Eng. in Electronic
and Information Engineering at Osaka Univeristy. While I am currently living
in Japan, I spent my childhood in Vienna.

My current research interests include Message Passing Interface (MPI) and
interconnection networks of high-performance computing systems. Specifically,
I have been working on how to dynamically reconfigure interconnects based
on the communication pattern of MPI applications. I am also interested in
other fields of parallel and distributed computing as well.

Besides my main research project, I am part of a joint research project
between [TIS Inc.](https://www.tis.co.jp/) and Cybermedia Center towards
building a sharing economy platform for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. As
the lead developer of the project, my mission is to design and implement
proof-of-concept software. Some of the outcomes has been open-sourced.

I have been working as a part-time programmer for more than 7 years.
During my carrier, I designed and developed a wide variety of software
including image analysis, signal processing, factory automation, desktop and
web applications.
